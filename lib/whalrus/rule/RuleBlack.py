    Black's rule.

    :param rule_borda: a Rule. Used as the secondary victory criterion. Default: :class:`RuleBorda`.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    As a main victory criterion, the Condorcet winner is elected (even if it does not have the highest Borda score):

    >>> rule = RuleBlack(ballots=['a > b > c', 'b > c > a'], weights=[3, 2])
    >>> rule.rule_condorcet_.matrix_majority_.matrix_weighted_majority_.as_array_
    array([[0, Fraction(3, 5), Fraction(3, 5)],
           [Fraction(2, 5), 0, 1],
           [Fraction(2, 5), 0, 0]], dtype=object)
    >>> rule.order_
    [{'a'}, {'b'}, {'c'}]

    When there is no Condorcet winner, candidates are sorted according to their Borda scores:

    >>> rule = RuleBlack(ballots=['a > b > c', 'b > c > a', 'c > a > b'], weights=[3, 2, 2])
    >>> rule.rule_condorcet_.matrix_majority_.matrix_weighted_majority_.as_array_
