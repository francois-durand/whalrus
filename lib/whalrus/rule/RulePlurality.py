    The plurality rule.

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param converter: the default is :class:`ConverterBallotToPlurality`.
    :param scorer: the default is :class:`ScorerPlurality`.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the rule:

    >>> plurality = RulePlurality(tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load a particular election (profile, candidates):

    >>> plurality(ballots=['a', 'b', 'c'], weights=[2, 2, 1], voters=['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cate'],
    ...           candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'})  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    <... object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

    >>> plurality.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0}
    >>> plurality.winner_
    'a'

    Later, if you wish, you can load another profile with the same voting rule, and so on.

    Optionally, you can specify an election (profile and candidates) as soon as the :class:`Rule` object is initialized.
    This allows for one-liners such as:

    >>> RulePlurality(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']).winner_
    'a'

    Cf. :class:`Rule` for more information about the arguments.
