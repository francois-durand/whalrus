    """
    The two-round system.

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param rule1: the first rule. Default: :class:`RulePlurality`.
    :param rule2: the second rule. Default: :class:`RulePlurality`.
    :param elimination: the elimination algorithm used during the first round. Default: :class:`EliminationLast`
        with ``k=-2``, which only keeps the 2 best candidates.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    With its default settings, this class implements the classic two-round system, using plurality at both rounds:

    >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
    ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1])
    >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'e': 0}
    >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2}

    Using the options, some more exotic two-round systems can be defined, such as changing the rule of a round:

    >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
    ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1], rule1=RuleBorda())
    >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 17, 'b': 16, 'c': 12, 'd': 5, 'e': 0}
    >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2}

    ... or changing the elimination algorithm:

    >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
    ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1], elimination=EliminationLast(k=-3))
    >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'e': 0}
    >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
