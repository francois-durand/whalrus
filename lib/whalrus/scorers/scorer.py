class Scorer(DeleteCacheMixin):
    """
    A "scorer".

    A :class:`Scorer` is a callable whose inputs are a ballot, a voter and a set of candidates (the set of candidates
    of the election).  When the scorer is called, it loads its arguments. The output of the call is the scorer
    itself. But after the call, you can access to the computed variables (ending with an underscore),
    such as :attr:`scores_`.

    At the initialization of a :class:`Scorer` object, some options can be given, such as a scale. In some
    subclasses, there can be some additional options.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args
        If present, these parameters will be passed to ``__call__`` immediately after initialization.
    scale : Scale
        The scale in which scores are computed.
    kwargs
        If present, these parameters will be passed to ``__call__`` immediately after initialization.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ballot_: Ballot
        This attribute stores the ballot given in argument of the ``__call__``.
    voter_: object
        This attribute stores the voter given in argument of the ``__call__``.
    candidates_: NiceSet
        This attribute stores the candidates given in argument of the ``__call__``.

    Examples
    --------
    Cf. :class:`ScorerLevels` for some examples.
