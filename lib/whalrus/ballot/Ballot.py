class Ballot:
    """
    A ballot.

    The philosophy of this class is to stick as much as possible to the message that the voter emitted, in the
    context where she emitted it. For example, consider a range voting setting with candidates `a`, `b`, `c`
    and a scale of grades from 0 to 100. If the voter emits a ballot where `a` has grade 60 and `b` has grade 30, then
    the :class:`Ballot` object simply records all this: what candidates were present, what was the scale of authorized
    grades, and what the voter indicated in her ballot. But, for example:

    * It makes no assumption whether the voter prefers `a` to `c`. Maybe she did not mention `c` because she didn't
      like it, maybe because she didn't know it.
    * It makes no assumption about what would be the voter's ballot with a scale from 0 to 10. Maybe it would be
      ``{'a': 6, 'b': 3}``, maybe not.

    Ballot converters (cf. :class:`ConverterBallot`) will be used each time we need an information that is beyond
    what the ballot clearly indicated.

        The candidates that were available at the moment when the voter cast her ballot.

        :return: a :class:`NiceSet`. As a consequence, candidates must be hashable objects.

    def first(self, candidates: set = None, **kwargs) -> object:
        """
        The first (= most liked) candidate. Implementation is optional.

        :param candidates: a set of candidates (it can be any set of candidates, not necessarily a subset of
            ``self.candidates``). Default: ``self.candidates``.
        :param kwargs: some options (depending on the subclass).
        :return: the first (= most liked) candidate, chosen in the intersection of ``self.candidates`` and the argument
            ``candidates``. Can return None for an "abstention".

        Typical example: the ballot was cast in a context where candidates `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` were declared. Hence
        ``self.candidates == {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}``. Later, candidate `a` is removed from the election. Then we can
        use this method with the optional argument ``candidates = {'b', 'c', 'd'}`` to know who is the most liked
        candidate of the voter in this new context.

        In most subclasses, this method needs some options (``kwargs``) to solve ambiguities in this conversion. In
        some other subclasses, this method may even stay unimplemented.

        Restrict the ballot to less candidates. Implementation is optional.

        :return: the same ballot, "restricted" to the candidates given.

        Additional candidates (that are in the argument ``candidates`` but not in ``self.candidates``) are generally not
        taken into account in the restricted ballot. For example, in a election with candidates `a`, `b`, `c`, assume
        that the voter emits an ordered ballot ``a > b > c``. Later, candidate `a` is removed and candidate `d` is
        added. Then the "restricted" ballot to ``{'b, 'c', 'd'}`` is ``b > c``. For more details, see for example
        :meth:`BallotOrder.restrict`.
