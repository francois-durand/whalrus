    An :class:`Elimination` object is a callable whose input is a :class:`Rule` (which has already loaded a profile).
    When the :class:`Elimination` object is called, it loads the rule. The output of the call is the
    :class:`Elimination` object itself. But after the call, you can access to the computed variables (ending with an
    underscore), such as :attr:`eliminated_order_`, :attr:`eliminated_` or :attr:`qualified_`.

    Cf. :class:`EliminationLast` for some examples.
