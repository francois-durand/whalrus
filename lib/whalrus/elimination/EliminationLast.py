class EliminationLast(Elimination):
    """
    Elimination of the last candidates (with a fixed number of candidates to eliminate, or to qualify).

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param k: an nonzero integer. The number of eliminated candidates. If this number is negative, then
        ``len(rule.candidates_) - abs(k)`` candidates are eliminated, i.e. ``abs(k)`` candidates are qualified.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the elimination method:

    >>> elimination = EliminationLast(k=1)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load a particular election (rule, profile, candidates):

    >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> elimination(rule)  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    <... object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

    >>> elimination.eliminated_
    {'c'}

    Later, if you wish, you can load another election with the same elimination method, and so on.

    Optionally, you can specify an election (rule, profile, candidates) as soon as the :class:`Elimination` object is
    initialized. This allows for one-liners such as:

    >>> EliminationLast(rule=RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c']), k=1).eliminated_
    {'c'}

    Typical usage with ``k = 1`` (e.g. for :class:`RuleIRV`):

    >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
    ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
    >>> EliminationLast(rule=rule, k=1).eliminated_
    {'e'}

    Typical usage with ``k = -2`` (e.g. for :class:`RuleTwoRound`):

    >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
    ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
    >>> EliminationLast(rule=rule, k=-2).qualified_
    {'a', 'b'}

    Order of elimination:

    >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
    ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
    >>> EliminationLast(rule=rule, k=-2).eliminated_order_
    [{'c'}, {'d', 'e'}]

    There must always be at least one eliminated candidate. If it is not possible to eliminate (case ``k`` > 0)  or keep
    (case ``k`` < 0) as many candidates as required, then everybody is eliminated:

    >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a'])
    >>> EliminationLast(rule=rule, k=1).eliminated_
    {'a'}
    >>> EliminationLast(rule=rule, k=-2).eliminated_
    {'a'}
