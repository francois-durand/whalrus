    The two-round system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args
        Cf. parent class.
    rule1
        The first rule. Default: :class:`RulePlurality`.
    rule2
        The second rule. Default: :class:`RulePlurality`.
    elimination : Elimination
        The elimination algorithm used during the first round. Default: :class:`EliminationLast` with ``k=-2``, which
        only keeps the 2 best candidates.
    kwargs
        Cf. parent class.

    Examples
    --------
    With its default settings, this class implements the classic two-round system, using plurality at both rounds:

        >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
        ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1])
        >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'e': 0}
        >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 3, 'b': 2}

    Using the options, some more exotic two-round systems can be defined, such as changing the rule of a round:

        >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
        ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1], rule1=RuleBorda())
        >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 17, 'b': 16, 'c': 12, 'd': 5, 'e': 0}
        >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 3, 'b': 2}

    ... or changing the elimination algorithm:

        >>> rule = RuleTwoRound(['a > b > c > d > e', 'b > a > c > d > e', 'c > a > b > d > e'],
        ...                     weights=[2, 2, 1], elimination=EliminationLast(k=-3))
        >>> rule.first_round_.rule_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'e': 0}
        >>> rule.second_round_.gross_scores_
        {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
