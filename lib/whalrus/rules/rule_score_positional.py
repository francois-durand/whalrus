    A positional scoring rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args
        Cf. parent class.
    converter : ConverterBallot
        Default: :class:`ConverterBallotToStrictOrder`.
    points_scheme : list
        The list of points to be attributed to the candidates of a ballot. Cf. :class:`ScorerPositional`.
    kwargs
        Cf. parent class.

    Examples
    --------
        >>> RuleScorePositional(['a > b > c', 'b > c > a'], points_scheme=[3, 2, 1]).gross_scores_
        {'a': 4, 'b': 5, 'c': 3}

    Since this voting rule needs strict orders, problems may occur as soon as there is indifference in the ballots. To
    avoid these issues, specify the ballot converter explicitly:

        >>> RuleScorePositional(['a > b ~ c', 'b > c > a'], points_scheme=[1, 1, 0],
        ...     converter=ConverterBallotToStrictOrder(priority=Priority.ASCENDING)).gross_scores_
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
