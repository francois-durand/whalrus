class ScorerLevels(Scorer):
    """
    A standard scorer for :class:``BallotLevel``.

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param level_ungraded: the level of the scale used for ungraded candidates, or None.
    :param level_absent: the level of the scale used for absent candidates, or None.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the scorer:

    >>> scorer = ScorerLevels(level_absent=0)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load some particular arguments:

    >>> scorer(ballot=BallotLevels({'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3}), voter='Alice',
    ...        candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'})  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    <... object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

    >>> scorer.scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3, 'd': 0}

    Later, if you wish, you can load other arguments (ballot, etc) with the same scorer, and so on.

    Optionally, you can specify arguments as soon as the :class:`Scorer` object is initialized. This allows for
    "one-liners" such as:

    >>> ScorerLevels(ballot=BallotLevels({'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3}), voter='Alice',
    ...              candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}, level_absent=0).scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3, 'd': 0}

    In the example below, candidates `a`, `b` and `c` are "ordered", `d` is "unordered", and `e` is "absent"
    in the ballot, meaning that `e` were not even available when the voter cast her ballot. The options of the
    scorer provide different ways to take these special cases into account:

    >>> ballot=BallotLevels({'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3}, candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'})
    >>> candidates_election = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}
    >>> ScorerLevels(ballot, candidates=candidates_election).scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3}
    >>> ScorerLevels(ballot, candidates=candidates_election,
    ...              level_ungraded=-5).scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3, 'd': -5}
    >>> ScorerLevels(ballot, candidates=candidates_election,
    ...              level_ungraded=-5, level_absent=-10).scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 7, 'c': 3, 'd': -5, 'e': -10}
