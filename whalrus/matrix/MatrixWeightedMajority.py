    The weighted majority matrix.

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param converter: the default is :class:`ConverterBallotToOrder`.

    :param lower_vs_higher: number of points for candidate `c` when it is ordered lower than candidate `d`.

    :param absent_vs_absent: number of points for candidate `c` when it is absent and `d` is absent.
    :param diagonal_score: value of the diagonal coefficients.
    :param default_score: default score in the matrix in case of division by 0 (except for the diagonal coefficients).
    :param antisymmetric: if True, then an antisymmetric version of the matrix is computed (by subtracting the
        transposed matrix at the end of the computation).
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the matrix computation algorithm:

    >>> matrix = MatrixWeightedMajority(diagonal_score=.5)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load a particular election (profile, candidates):

    >>> matrix(ballots=['a > b', 'b > a'], weights=[3, 1], voters=['v', 'w'], candidates={'a', 'b'})  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    <... object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

    >>> matrix.as_array_
    array([[Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(3, 4)],
           [Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 2)]], dtype=object)

    Later, if you wish, you can load another profile with the same matrix computation algorithm, and so on.

    Optionally, you can specify an election (profile and candidates) as soon as the :class:`Matrix` object is
    initialized. This allows for "one-liners" such as:

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots=['a > b', 'b > a'], weights=[3, 1], voters=['x', 'y'],
    ...                        candidates={'a', 'b'}, diagonal_score=.5).as_array_
    array([[Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(3, 4)],
           [Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 2)]], dtype=object)

    Antisymmetric version:

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots=['a > b', 'b > a'], weights=[3, 1], voters=['x', 'y'],
    ...                        candidates={'a', 'b'}, antisymmetric=True).as_array_
    array([[0, Fraction(1, 2)],
           [Fraction(-1, 2), 0]], dtype=object)

    An "unordered" candidate is a candidate that the voter has seen but not included in her ranking; i.e. it is in the
    attribute :attr:`BallotOrder.candidates_not_in_b` of the ballot. An "absent" candidate is a candidate that the
    voter has not even seen; i.e. it is in ``self.candidates_``, but not the attribute :attr:`Ballot.candidates` of the
    ballot. For all the "scoring" parameters (from ``higher_vs_lower`` to ``absent_vs_absent``), the value None can
    be used. In that case, the corresponding occurrences are not taken into account in the average (neither the
    numerator, not the denominator). Consider this example:

    >>> ballots = ['a > b', 'a ~ b']

    With ``indifference=Fraction(1, 2)`` (default), the ratio of voters who prefer `a` to `b` is
    (1 + 1 / 2) / 2 = 3 / 4 (the indifferent voter gives 1 / 2 point and is counted in the denominator):

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots).as_array_
    array([[0, Fraction(3, 4)],
           [Fraction(1, 4), 0]], dtype=object)

    With ``indifference=0``, the ratio of voters who prefer `a` to `b` is 1 / 2 (the indifferent voter
    gives no point, but is counted in the denominator):

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots, indifference=0).as_array_
    array([[0, Fraction(1, 2)],
           [0, 0]], dtype=object)

    With ``indifference=None``, the ratio of voters who prefer `a` to `b` is 1 / 1 = 1 (the indifferent voter is not
    counted in the average at all):

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots, indifference=None).as_array_
    array([[0, 1],
           [0, 0]])
