    A multi-winner rule that select the best committee according using transferable votes.

    -----------

    A quota q is calculated as q = floor(n/k+1) + 1 where n is the number of voters and k the size of the committee to be elected.
    At each round, we check if the plurality winner score is greater than the quota:
        If it's the case, we transfer the surplus to each possible second choice according to their proportion in the whole set of ballots
        where the winner is in first choice.
    If not:
        We eliminate the lowest plurality candidate.
    We perform rounds until the remaining candidates (included thoses elected) reaches the size of the committee
