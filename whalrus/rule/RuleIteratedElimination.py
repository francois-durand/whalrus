class RuleIteratedElimination(Rule):
    """
    A rule by iterated elimination (such as :class:`RuleIRV`, :class:`RuleCoombs`, :class:`RuleNanson`, etc.)

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param base_rule: the rule used at each round to determine the eliminated candidate(s). Unlike for
        :class:`RuleSequentialElimination`, all the rounds use the same voting rule.
    :param elimination: the elimination algorithm. Default: ``EliminationLast(k=1)``.
    :param propagate_tie_break: if True (default), then the tie-breaking rule of this object is also used for the
        base rule (cf. below).
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    >>> irv = RuleIteratedElimination(['a > b > c', 'b > a > c', 'c > a > b'], weights=[2, 3, 4],
    ...                                 base_rule=RulePlurality())
    >>> irv.eliminations_[0].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
    >>> irv.eliminations_[1].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'b': 5, 'c': 4}
    >>> irv.eliminations_[2].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'b': 9}
    >>> irv.winner_
    'b'

    Remark: there exists a shortcut for the above rule in particular, the class :class:`RuleIRV`.

    By default, ``propagate_tie_break`` is True. So if you want to specify a tie-breaking rule, just do it in the
    parameters of this object, and it will also be used in the base rule. This is probably what you want to do:

    >>> irv = RuleIteratedElimination(['a > c > b', 'b > a > c', 'c > a > b'], weights=[1, 2, 1],
    ...                                 base_rule=RulePlurality(), tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
    >>> irv.eliminations_[0].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
    >>> irv.eliminations_[1].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    >>> irv.eliminations_[2].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 4}
    >>> irv.winner_
    'a'

    If ``propagate_tie_break`` is False, then there is a subtlety between the tie-breaking rule of this object, and the
    tie-breaking rule of the base rule. The following (somewhat contrived) example illustrates the respective roles of
    the two tie-breaking rules.

    >>> rule = RuleIteratedElimination(
    ...     ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], weights=[3, 2, 2, 2, 1],
    ...     tie_break=Priority.DESCENDING, propagate_tie_break=False,
    ...     base_rule=RulePlurality(tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING), elimination=EliminationLast(k=2))
    >>> rule.eliminations_[0].rule_.gross_scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'd': 2, 'e': 1}

    With the worst score, ``e`` is eliminated anyway, but we need to eliminate a second candidate because ``k = 2``. In
    Plurality, ``b``, ``c`` and ``d`` are tied, but since Plurality's tie-breaking rule is ``ASCENDING``, candidates
    ``b`` or ``c`` get an advantage over ``d``. Hence ``d`` is eliminated:

    >>> rule.eliminations_[0].eliminated_
    {'d', 'e'}

    Note that the tie-breaking rule of the base rule (here Plurality) is always sufficient to compute the weak order
    over the candidates. This order may be finer than the elimination order, because being eliminated at the same
    time does not mean being tied, as ``d`` and ``e`` illustrate here:

    >>> rule.order_
    [{'a'}, {'b', 'c'}, {'d'}, {'e'}]

    So, where does the tie-breaking rule of this object come in? It is simply used to get the strict order over
    the candidates, as usual in a :class:`Rule`. In our example, since it is ``DESCENDING``, candidate ``c`` gets an
    advantage over ``b``:

    >>> rule.strict_order_
    ['a', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'e']
