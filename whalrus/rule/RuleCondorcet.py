    winner, then all candidates are tied.

    More precisely, and in all generality, a candidate is considered a `Condorcet winner` if all the non-diagonal
    coefficients on its raw of :attr:`matrix_majority_` are equal to 1. With the default setting of ``matrix_majority =
    MatrixMajority()``, the Condorcet winner is necessarily unique when it exists, but that might not be the case
    with some more exotic settings:
