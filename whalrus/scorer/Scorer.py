    A :class:`Scorer` is a callable whose inputs are a ballot, a voter and a set of candidates (the set of candidates
    of the election).  When the scorer is called, it loads its arguments. The output of the call is the scorer
    itself. But after the call, you can access to the computed variables (ending with an underscore),
    such as :attr:`scores_`.

    At the initialization of a :class:`Scorer` object, some options can be given, such as a scale. In some
    subclasses, there can be some additional options.

    Cf. :class:`ScorerLevels` for some examples.
