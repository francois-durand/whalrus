class ScorerPositional(Scorer):
    """
    A positional scorer for strict order ballots.

    :param `*args`: cf. parent class.
    :param points_scheme: the list of points to be attributed to the (first) candidates of a ballot.
    :param points_fill: points for ordered candidates that have a rank beyond the ``points_scheme``.
    :param points_unordered: points for the unordered candidates.
    :param points_absent: points for the absent candidates.
    :param `**kwargs`: cf. parent class.

    The top candidate in the ballot receives ``points_scheme[0]`` points, the second one receives ``points_scheme[1]``
    points, etc:

    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot=BallotOrder('a > b > c'), points_scheme=[10, 5, 3]).scores_
    {'a': 10, 'b': 5, 'c': 3}

    The points scheme does not need to have the same length as the ballot:

    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot=BallotOrder('a > b > c'), points_scheme=[3, 2, 1, .5]).scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot=BallotOrder('a > b > c'), points_scheme=[3, 2]).scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 0}

    A typical usage of this is k-Approval voting:

    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot=BallotOrder('a > b > c > d > e'), points_scheme=[1, 1]).scores_
    {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 0, 'd': 0, 'e': 0}

    In the example below, candidates `a`, `b` and `c` are "ordered", `d` is "unordered", and `e` is "absent"
    in the ballot, meaning that `e` was not even available when the voter cast her ballot. The options of the
    scorer provide different ways to take these special cases into account:

    >>> ballot=BallotOrder('a > b > c', candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'})
    >>> candidates_election = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}
    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot, candidates=candidates_election, points_scheme=[3, 2]).scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 0, 'd': 0}
    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot, candidates=candidates_election, points_scheme=[3, 2],
    ...     points_fill=-1, points_unordered=-2, points_absent=-3).scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': -1, 'd': -2, 'e': -3}
    >>> ScorerPositional(ballot, candidates=candidates_election, points_scheme=[3, 2],
    ...     points_fill=None, points_unordered=None, points_absent=None).scores_
    {'a': 3, 'b': 2}
