class SelectionFirst(Selection):

    Parameters
    ----------
    args
        Cf. parent class.
    k : int
        A nonzero integer. The number of eliminated candidates. If this number is negative, then
        ``len(rule.candidates_) - abs(k)`` candidates are eliminated, i.e. ``abs(k)`` candidates are qualified.
    kwargs`
        Cf. parent class.

    Examples
    --------
    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the elimination method:

        >>> selection = SelectionFirst(k=1)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load a particular election (rule, profile, candidates):

        >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a','a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c'])
        >>> selection(rule)  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        <... object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

        >>> selection.selected_
        {'a'}

    Later, if you wish, you can load another election with the same selection method, and so on.

    Optionally, you can specify an election (rule, profile, candidates) as soon as the :class:`Selection` object is
    initialized. This allows for one-liners such as:

        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=RulePlurality(ballots=['a','a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c']), k=1).selected_
        {'a'}

    Typical usage with ``k = 1`` (e.g. for :class:`RuleIRV`):

        >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
        ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=rule, k=1).selected_
        {'a'}

    Typical usage with ``k = -2`` (e.g. for :class:`RuleTwoRound`):

        >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
        ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=rule, k=-2).remaining_
        {'d', 'e'}

    Order of selection:

        >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
        ...                      tie_break=Priority.ASCENDING)
        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=rule, k=-2).selected_order_
        [{'b', 'c'}, {'a'}]

    There must always be at least one selection candidate. If it is not possible to select (case ``k`` > 0)  or keep
    (case ``k`` < 0) as many candidates as required, then everybody is selected:

        >>> rule = RulePlurality(ballots=['a'])
        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=rule, k=1).selected_
        {'a'}
        >>> SelectionFirst(rule=rule, k=-2).selected_
        {'a'}
